**`Digital Craftsman (Student/Developer)`**

I am 25 years old, and currently live in London. I am South African, but have the right to stay and work in the UK. I have been working and studying full time for the last 4 years and have an Honours degree in Computing and IT. I am obsessed with learning, and am on a journey to build a succesful career as a software developer. At this point in time my biggest interests are AI and crypto.
